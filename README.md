Built with Nextcord and MongoDB

To get set up, run the following in your cloned directory (Windows).
You must also have python installed.

pip install nextcord
pip install pymongo
pip install "pymongo[srv]"
pip install python-dotenv

In order to develop, you must ask me for the MongoDB connection string and Discord token
