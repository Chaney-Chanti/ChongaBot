# ChongaBot
Built with Nextcord and MongoDB

# Rules
## Description
Build a nation, and gather resources to grow stronger, and defeat your enemies.

## How to play
Gather resources {Food, Timber, Metal, Wealth, Oil, and Knowledge}. At the start, every resource
is mined at a rate of 100. Build buildings {Granary, Water Mill, Quarry, Market, Oil Rig, University}.
to increase the rate of resource production which will also be increased based on age {Medieval(starting)[+100], Enlightment[+200], Modern[+300], Space[+400]}.
Units strength is based on a dice roll cap where units can roll from 1-n where n is the cap of the unit dice roll.
Go to the next age to have access to stronger units and more efficient resource collection. 
Attack other players and steal 20% of their resource and gain a 3x (of what you stole) bonus loot.
Battle rating reveals the strength of an empire (+25 for a win -25 for a loss).
Attacked players gain a 24 hour shield to rebuild and cannot be attacked. You may only attack players within +/-300 BR of yourself.
